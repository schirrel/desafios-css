## Input with floating Label
Remember when material design appeared with its floating label and everyone thought it was great and a lot of people started to implement and generate libraries about it?

Well, are we going to do this with css only?

#### What you'll use
 - Siblings Selectors (`+`)
 - Pseudo Selectors (`: focus`,`: placeholder`, `: placeholder-shown`,`: not`)


 #### Rules
 Use only HTML and CSS.


 #### Requirements
  Is desirable that:
 - Create input with their respective labels
 - When an input has content or is focused, the label must float to the top of the input
