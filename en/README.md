Here you'll have a list of CSS'S challenges to improve you skills.

There are a  lot of levels to help you demystify this languange.

All challenges will only require css and html.


Altogether there will be 12 challenges that I recommend to be done once a week, for those who are starting with the css.
If you are more advanced you can do 3 per week, and for the more 'hard mode', you can do one per day in 12 days.
